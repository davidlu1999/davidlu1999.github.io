# [Energy-Efficient Keyword Spotting Accelerator](https://davidlu1999.github.io/posts/accelerator/) :
- Designed a low-power circuit that can identify ten keywords from one-second long utterances.

- Sent our design to Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute and taped out a depthwise separable convolution neural network (DSCNN) keyword spotting accelerator.

# [Training Personalized Recommendations in heterogeneous memory devices](https://davidlu1999.github.io/posts/mfcc/):

- Investigated diff erent systems’ impacts on training recommender system.

- Applied process-in-memory architecture and heterogeneous memory(HBM and DIMM) to accelerate the training time of the recommender system.

# [FPGA Voice Recorder](https://davidlu1999.github.io/posts/FPGA/):

- Implemented I<sup>2</sup>C to initialize the WM8731 chip.

- Controlled the DAT/CLK signals of the WM8731 chip to make a recorder.

# [Gauss-Seidel Iteration Machine](https://davidlu1999.github.io/posts/GSIM/):

- Designed a low power, low latency, and low area circuit to solve a linear equation with sixteen unknown.

- Utilized the Gauss–Seidel method iterated 16 times to acquire the final answer.

# [Image Processing Filter](https://davidlu1999.github.io/posts/Gauss-Seidel-Iteration-Machine/):

- Designed an Image Processing Filter that can process data with three diff erent operations.

- Ranked third among 26 groups.

# [Investigating Ferroelectric Minor Loop Dynamics and History Effect](https://davidlu1999.github.io/posts/ferro/) :

- Constructed multiple phase-fi eld models based on the time-dependent Landau–Ginzburg framework to simulate phase-fi eld multidomain switching model.

- Researched the correlation between ferroelectric material domain size and the coercive field.
