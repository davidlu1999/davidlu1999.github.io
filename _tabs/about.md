<!-- I am currently a graduate student at the **Cornell University**. In university, I joined the **Energy-Efficient Circuits and Systems Lab (EECS Lab)** to develop energy-efficient machine learning accelerators that can reduce the power consumption of IoT devices. Later, I did an internship at **Academia Sinica** (an eminent research institute in Taiwan) where I researched compute-in-memory architecture. I became familiar with low-power circuit design. I plan to continue exploring **machine learning accelerators in IoT devices** in my masterâ€™s studies. -->

Hello, I'm David, a dedicated electrical engineering student at **Cornell University** with a passion for designing efficient accelerators using **Verilog** and **System Verilog**. With a formal education in Computer-Aided VLSI System Design and Computer Architecture, I have a strong foundation in hardware design principles.
During my time at **Academia Sinica**, I had the opportunity to develop an innovative ReRAM genome sequence alignment accelerator, surpassing state-of-the-art solutions by a factor of 10 to 50. Currently, I am pursuing my **ECE MEng at Cornell University**, where I am further honing my skills in **ASIC design**.
If you're seeking a dedicated professional in **ASIC design**, I would be delighted to connect and explore potential collaboration opportunities. I am enthusiastic about contributing to innovative projects and bringing my skills to the table.
